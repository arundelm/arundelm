# Hey, I'm Michael (but I usually just go by Mick)

CS @ University of Michigan '26. I build things between classes and playing basketball.

### What I'm working on

🎲 **Social Wagering App** — building a wagering platform with friends. More on this soon.

🐦 **[TrendPoster]** — AI-powered tweet scheduler that watches trending topics and posts your queued tweets at the perfect moment. Supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, and local models.

### What I'm into

- AI agents & LLM tooling
- Automation — if I have to do it more than once, I'm scripting it
- Startups — building something big is the plan
- Web & mobile development
